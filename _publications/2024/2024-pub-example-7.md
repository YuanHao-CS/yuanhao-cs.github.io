  Recent advancements in Instruction Tuning (IT) have shown promise for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with users' intentions, yet its efficacy is often compromised by dependence on high-quality datasets. Previous works have concentrated on the aggregation or production of huge IT datasets through human labor or significant cost-intensive LLM APIs, which lacks adequate mechanisms to guarantee the quality of the resulting data. Moreover, training on such amount of IT data is both time-consuming and costly. To address these issues, we present Bread (Instruction Mining through Balanced Retrieval And Dynamic Data Sampling), a novel approach designed to minimize the requisite volume of IT data. Bread uses a two-stage strategy combining balanced retrieval and dynamic sampling to focus on data diversity and quality, offering a cost-saving solution without relying on any specific LLMs. Experimental results suggest that Bread outperforms baselines and shows great flexibility across various IT datasets and LLMs, thereby marking a step forward in efficient Instruction Tuning.
