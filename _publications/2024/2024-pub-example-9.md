  The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heralded a new era in education. Moreover, by endowing Artificial Intelligence (AI) Agents with natural language processing (NLP) capabilities via the utilization of LLMs, AI Agents can actively engage in the learning process, thereby more precisely assessing learning outcomes and offering targeted assistance to learners, introducing novel pedagogical approaches. Drawing inspiration from the von Neumann Machine, this chapter delves into the role of AI Agents in the educational domain and introduces the von Neumann AI Agent Framework, which decomposes each AI Agent into four modules: the control unit, the logic unit, the memory unit, and the input-output devices. Grounded in the modular definition of AI Agents, they can accomplish task decomposition, self-reflection, memory processing, and tool invocation by accessing different modules, ultimately obtaining the desired output from learners. Additionally, we provide visual representations of the technologies associated with these tasks, such as Chain of Thought, Reson+Act, and Multi-Agent Debate. Following this, we examine the utilization of AI Agents in evaluating and improving learning outcomes, while briefly exploring the phenomenon of swarm intelligence that may manifest during the collaborative interactions of multiple AI Agents.
