abstract: >-
  The rapid advancement of technology, particularly generative artificial intelligence  (GenAI), is facilitating the education transformation. In response to the increasingly complex and  dynamic educational landscape, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a promising solution to address educational challenges due to their collaborative, distributed, and adaptive capabilities. This study begins by analyzing the core principles and evolutionary trajectory of MASs, focusing on their early applications in education. It explores the evolution of these systems from three critical  perspectives: Domain, structure, and application scenarios. On the technical front, the study delves into how GenAI enhances MASs by developing an "eye-brain-hand" capability framework using Large Language Models (LLM). Additionally, it introduces a dual-cycle framework to boost the intelligence of these systems. Regarding applications, the study provides an in-depth analysis of the diverse roles of MASs in education, including an encyclopedia-type Agent that facilitates knowledge management, an intelligent learning companion that fosters collaboration, a teaching assistant Agent that aids in learning planning, and a specialized teacher agent that supports subject-specific instruction. The study also highlights the potential of MASs for various educational contexts and cross-cultural environments. However, the implementation of MASs in education faces several challenges, such as ensuring system stability and security, mitigating potential negative impacts, and integrating the strengths of traditional  educational methods. To address these issues, the study proposes a range of strategies, including integrating educational elements, aligning with digital infrastructure, transforming educational paradigms, and enhancing security, ethics, and privacy safeguards. These measures reshape the educational ecosystem empowered by MASs and ensure its sustainable development. The study offers meaningful insights into intelligent educational technologies and contributes to the digitalization and  high-quality development of education.
