  Knowledge components (KCs) are the fundamental units of knowledge in education. A KC graph illustrates the relationships and dependencies between KCs. An accurate KC graph helps educators identify the root causes of learnersâ€™ poor performance on specific KCs, enabling targeted instructional interventions. We developed MAS-KCL, a KC graph structure learning algorithm that uses a multi-agent system driven by large language models for adaptive optimization of the KC graph. A bidirectional feedback mechanism is integrated to assess the value of edges and optimize graph structure learning efficiency. We validated this approach on both synthetic and real-world educational datasets, showing its effectiveness in learning path recognition, allowing teachers to design more targeted and effective learning plans.
