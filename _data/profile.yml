  Hello! I am a PhD candidate at the Shanghai Institute of Artificial Intelligence for Education, East China Normal University, majoring in AI for Education. Here, I lead the Outstanding Doctoral Research Program for Advancing Academic Innovation and am expected to graduate in July 2027. At the same time, I am also a joint doctoral student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research interests include AI for education, agentic workflow, human-computer interaction, and multimodal large language models. </br></br>Currently, I have served or will serve as a program committee member for tracks or workshops at the Global Chinese Conference on Computers in Education (GCCCE 2024), International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2024), AIED 2025, and International Conference on Computers in Education (ICCE 2025). I am a member of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education (AACE), and the Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI).
